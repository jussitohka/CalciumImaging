This repository contains Matlab research code to reproduce the analysis in 
Tiihonen et al. Neurobiological origins of schizophrenia, 2018.  

The code has been licenced under MIT licence (see LICENCE). It is made available for the purpose of documenting the analysis in the paper. It is a stripped version of more general code written for the analysis and quantification of fluorescent traces to be made available at some point. 

USAGE (females):

First, neurotrans_quant_sz_localf0.m is run for quantification

After this, neurotrans_analysis_sz.m is run for analysis

USAGE (males):

First, neurotrans_quant_sz_localf0_males.m is run for quantification

After this, neurotrans_analysis_sz_males.m is run for analysis
